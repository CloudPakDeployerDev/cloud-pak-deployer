# TODO(SJ): (Optional) Change implementation 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The CP4D version of the Deployer obtains here the admin password, 
# changes it and stores to the vault.

# In the current CP4I implementation we will just store password
# and Platform Navigator UI endpoint to the status directory.
# This happens in the role 80-smoke-tests/cp4d-cluster-show that 
# is invoked from the cp4-cluster/main.yml after this task.
