# Installing the Cloud Pak Deployer

## Install pre-requisites
Start with a server running a linux OS, like Red Hat or CentOS. MacOS should also work (with docker instead of podman).

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux of CentOS:
```
yum install -y podman git
yum clean all
```

On MacOS:
* Install Docker from the app store

## Clone the current repository
```
git clone https://github.ibm.com/CloudPakDeployer/cloud-pak-deployer.git
```

## Build the image
The container image must be built from the directory that holds the `Dockerfile` file.
```
cd cloud-pak-deployer
./cp-deploy.sh build
```

This process will take 2-10 minutes to complete and it will install all the pre-requisites needed to run the automation, including Ansible, Terraform, IBM Cloud CLI and operating system packages. For the installation to work, the system on which the image is built must be connected to the internet.
