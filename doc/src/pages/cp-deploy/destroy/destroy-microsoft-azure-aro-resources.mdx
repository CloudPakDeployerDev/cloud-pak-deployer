# Destroy the created resources

If you have previously used the Cloud Pak Deployer to create resources on Microsoft Azure, you can destroy the resources such as ARO cluster, vnet, subnets with the same command.

## Prepare for destroy

### Set environment variables

```
export STATUS_DIR=/data/status/sample
export CONFIG_DIR=/data/config/sample
```

- `STATUS_DIR`: The directory where the Cloud Pak Deployer keeps all status information and log files. **Please note** that if you have chosen to use a File Vault, the directory specified must be the one you used when you created the environment
- `CONFIG_DIR`: Directory that holds the configuration. This must be the same directory you used when you created the environment

## Run the Cloud Pak Deployer

Since the Cloud Pak Deployer creates all the resources within the resource group which you must specify as part of the configuration, the easiest way how to destroy is to remove the given resource group. Double-check your configuration and specify the `azure_resource_group_name` extra (dynamic) parameter in the following command. Mandatory credentials are automatically taken from the vault.

```
./cp-deploy.sh env destroy -e azure_resource_group_name=<your-resource-name> --confirm-destroy
```

When running the command, the container will start as a daemon and the command will tail-follow the logs. You can press Ctrl-C at any time to interrupt the logging but the container will continue to run in the background.

You can return to view the logs as follows:

```
./cp-deploy.sh env logs
```

If you need to interrupt the process, use CTRL-C to stop the logging output and then use:

```
./cp-deploy.sh env kill
```

## Finishing up

Once the process has finished successfully, you can delete the status directory.
