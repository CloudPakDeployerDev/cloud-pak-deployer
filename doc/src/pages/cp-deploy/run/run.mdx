# Running the Cloud Pak Deployer

## Create an IBM Cloud API Key
In order for the Cloud Pak Deplyer to create the infrastructure and deploy IBM Cloud Pak for Data, it must perform tasks on IBM Cloud. In order to do so it requires an IBM Cloud API Key. This can be created by following these steps:
- Log on to IBM Cloud on https://cloud.ibm.com/login and login with your IBMId credentials
- Ensure you have selected the correct IBM Cloud Account for which you wish to use the Cloud Pak Deployer
- Navigate to Manage --> Access (IAM)
- Select Api Keys
- Click **Create an IBM Cloud API Key** and provide a name and description
- Copy the IBM Cloud API key and store it, as you will not be able to retrieve it later

## Acquire an IBM Cloud Pak for Data Entitlement Key
For the Cloud Pak Deployer to access the IBM Cloud Pak for Data images, an entitlement key is required:
- Navigate to https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary and login with your IBMId credentials
- Select **Get Entitlement Key** and create a new key (or copy your existing key)
- Copy the key value and store it

## Create your configuration
The Cloud Pak Deployer requires the desired end-state to be configured in a pre-defined directory structure. This structure may exist on the server that runs the utility or can be pulled from a (branch of a) Git repository. 

### Create configuration directory structure
Use the following directory structure; you can copy a template from the `sample-configuration` directory included in this repository.
```
CONFIG_DIR  --> /config
                - sample.yaml
            --> /defaults
                - defaults.yaml
            --> /inventory
                - sample.inv
```
Adjust the `sample.yaml` and `sample.inv` to set the desired end-state of the deployment. Any missing configuration attributes will be completed from the `defaults` directory.

## Prepare for running

### Set environment variables
```
export IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key
export STATUS_DIR=/data/status/sample
export CONFIG_DIR=/data/config/sample
export CP_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=your_cp_entitlement_key
```

### Store Cloud Pak entitlement key in vault
```
./cp-deploy.sh vault set \
  --status-dir ${STATUS_DIR} \
  --config-dir ${CONFIG_DIR} \
  --vault-secret ibm_cp_entitlement_key \
  --vault-secret-value ${CP_ENTITLEMENT_KEY}
```

### Run with a local configuration directory
To run the container using a local configuration input directory and a data directory where temporary and state is kept, use the example below. If you don't specify the `LOG_DATA_DIR` parameter, the deployer will automatically create a temporary directy. Please note that the temporary status directory will also hold secrets if you have configured a flat file vault. If you lose the directory, you will not be able to make changes to the configuration and adjust the deployment. It is best to specify a permanent directory that you can reuse later. If you specify an existing directory the current user **must** be the owner of the directory. Failing to do so may cause the container to fail with insufficient permissions.

```
./cp-deploy.sh env apply \
 --status-dir ${STATUS_DIR} \
 --config-dir ${CONFIG_DIR} \
 --ibm-cloud-api-key ${IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY}
```

When running the command, the container will be run as a daemon and the command will tail-follow the logs. You can press Ctrl-C at any time to interrupt the logging but the container will continue to run in the background.

If you need to interrupt the automation, use CTRL-C to stop the output then use:
```
podman ps
```

or, on Mac/Ubuntu/Windows:
```
docker ps
```

If multiple containers are active you can double-check that you're terminating the correct container by doing a `podman logs <container name>`.

Then, stop the container as follows:
```
podman kill <container name>
```

or, on Mac/Ubuntu/Windows:
```
docker kill <container name>
```

After the installation is completed, the Terraform tfstate file is stored into the vault. When re-running the automation script it fetches the tfstate file from the vault.
