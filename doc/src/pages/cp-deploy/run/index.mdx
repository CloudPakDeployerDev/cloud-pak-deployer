# Running the Cloud Pak Deployer

## Create an IBM Cloud API Key
In order for the Cloud Pak Deployer to create the infrastructure and deploy IBM Cloud Pak for Data, it must perform tasks on IBM Cloud. In order to do so it requires an IBM Cloud API Key. This can be created by following these steps:
- Go to https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys and login with your IBMId credentials
- Ensure you have selected the correct IBM Cloud Account for which you wish to use the Cloud Pak Deployer
- Click **Create an IBM Cloud API Key** and provide a name and description
- Copy the IBM Cloud API key using the **Copy** button and store it in a safe place, as you will not be able to retrieve it later

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
You can choose to download the API key for later reference. However, when we reference the API key, we mean the IBM Cloud API key as a 40+ character string.

## Acquire an IBM Cloud Pak for Data Entitlement Key
For the Cloud Pak Deployer to access the IBM Cloud Pak for Data images, an entitlement key is required:
- Navigate to https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary and login with your IBMId credentials
- Select **Get Entitlement Key** and create a new key (or copy your existing key)
- Copy the key value

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
As stated for the API key, you can choose to download entitlement key. However, when we reference the entitlement key, we mean the 80+ character string.

## Prepare for running

### Set environment variables
```
export IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key
export CP_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=your_cp_entitlement_key

export STATUS_DIR=/data/status/sample
export CONFIG_DIR=/data/config/sample
```

* `IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY`: This is the API key you generated using your IBM Cloud account, this is a 40+ character string
* `CP_ENTITLEMENT_KEY`: This is the entitlement key you acquired as per the instructions above, this is a 80+ character string
* `STATUS_DIR`: The directory where the Cloud Pak Deployer keeps all status information and logs files. **Please note** that if you have chosen to use a File Vault, the properties file is keps under the `vault` directory within the status directory
* `CONFIG_DIR`: Directory that holds the configuration, it must have `config`, `defaults` and `inventory` subdirectories

### Store Cloud Pak entitlement key in vault
If you want to pull the Cloud Pak images from the entitlted registry (i.e. an online install), or if you want to mirror the images to your private registry namespace, you need to create a secret called `ibm_cp_entitlement_key` and set its value to your entitlement key.
```
./cp-deploy.sh vault set \
  --vault-secret ibm_cp_entitlement_key \
  --vault-secret-value ${CP_ENTITLEMENT_KEY}
```

## Run the Cloud Pak Deployer
To run the container using a local configuration input directory and a data directory where temporary and state is kept, use the example below. If you don't specify the status directory, the deployer will automatically create a temporary directy. Please note that the status directory will also hold secrets if you have configured a flat file vault. If you lose the directory, you will not be able to make changes to the configuration and adjust the deployment. It is best to specify a permanent directory that you can reuse later. If you specify an existing directory the current user **must** be the owner of the directory. Failing to do so may cause the container to fail with insufficient permissions.
```
./cp-deploy.sh env apply \
 --ibm-cloud-api-key ${IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY}
```

When running the command, the container will start as a daemon and the command will tail-follow the logs. You can press Ctrl-C at any time to interrupt the logging but the container will continue to run in the background.

If you need to interrupt the automation, use CTRL-C to stop the output then use:
```
podman ps
```

or, on Mac/Ubuntu/Windows:
```
docker ps
```

If multiple containers are active you can double-check that you're terminating the correct container by doing a `podman logs <container name>`.

Then, stop the container as follows:
```
podman kill <container name>
```

or, on Mac/Ubuntu/Windows:
```
docker kill <container name>
```

## Finishing up
Once the process has finished, it will output the URLs by which you can access the deployed Cloud Pak. You can also find this information under the `cloud-paks` directory in the status directory you specified. The `admin` password can be retrieved from the vault as follows:

TODO: Command to retrieve admin password
```
```
