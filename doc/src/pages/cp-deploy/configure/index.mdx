# Cloud Pak Deployer Configuration

The Cloud Pak Deployer includes several sample configurations which you can use as a basis for your own configuration. You can find sample configuration `yaml` files in the `sample-configurations/sample-config/config-samples` directory of the repository and descriptions in `sample-configurations/sample-config/sample-descriptions`.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
If you want to make changes to the example configurations, it is best to copy the example directory and not to place it under the repository directory structure, otherwise you may not be able to update (pull) the repository with changes applied on github.ibm.com.
</InlineNotification>

Example of copying a configuration directory to your user home directory:
```
cp -r ./sample-configurations/sample-roks-vpc-nfs-cp4d ~/sample-config
```

## Configuration steps
* Copy the sample configuration directory to your user home directory:
```
mkdir -p /data/config
cp -r ./sample-configurations/sample-config /data/confg/sample
cd /data/config/sample
```
* Update the inventory file `./inventory/sample.inv` to uncomment the `cloud_platform` that matches the infrastructure you're targeting
* Copy the relevant "ocp-..." file from the `./config-samples` direcotry to the `./config` directory, for example:
```
cp ./config-samples/ocp-ibm-cloud-roks-ocs.yaml ./config/
```
* Copy the relevant "cp4d-..." file from the `./config-samples` direcotry to the `./config` directory, for example:
```
cp ./config-samples/cp4d-408.yaml ./config/
```
* Edit the "config/cp4d-....yaml" file and select the cartridges to be installed by changing the state to `installed`
```
vi ./config/cp4d-408.yaml
```

The configurations typically work without any configuration changes and will create all referenced objects, including OpenShift cluster, cloud infrastructure such as VPCs, SSH keys, subnets, NFS servers and OCS storage nodes if specified. There is typically no need to change address prefixes and subnets. The IP addresses used by the provisioned components are private to the VPC and are not externally exposed.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
Do not create any of the specified objects referenced in the configuration yourself. The deployer has not been designed to change an existing OpenShift cluster or existing Coud Pak installation.

## Directory structure

Every configuration has a fixed directory structure, consisting of mandatory and optional subdirectories.
![Directory structure](./directory-structure.png)

Mandatory subdirectories:
* `config`: Keeps one or more `yaml` files with your OpenShift and Cloud Pak configuration
* `inventory`: Holds global settings for the configuration such as environment name and type of vault you want to use

Additionally, there are 2 optional subdirectories:
* `defaults`: Directory that keeps the defaults which will be merged with your configuration
* `assets`: Keeps directories of assets which must be deployed onto the Cloud Pak

### `config` directory
You can choose to keep only a single file per subdirectory or, for more complex configurations, you can create multiple yaml files. You can find a full list of all supported object types here: [Configuration objects](/cpd-design/objects/objects). The generator automatically merges all `.yaml` files in the config and defaults directory. In the sample configurations we split configuration of the OpenShift `ocp-...` and Cloud Pak `cp4.-...` objects.

For example, your `config` directory could hold the following files:
```
cp4d-408.yaml
ocp-ibm-cloud-roks-ocs.yaml
```

This will provision a ROKS cluster on IBM Cloud with OpenShift Data Foundation (fka OCS) and Cloud Pak for Data 4.0.8.

### `inventory` directory
The Cloud Pak Deployer pipeline has been built using Ansible and it can be configured using "inventory" files. Inventory files hold the global parameters which are available throughout the Ansible playbooks. 

The most important configuration you will find in the Cloud Pak Deployer's inventory files are the cloud platform and vault configuration. All samples default to the **File Vault**, meaning that the vault will be kept in the `vault` directory under the status directory you specify when you run the deployer. Detailed descriptions of the vault settings can be found in the sample inventory file and also here: [vault settings](/cpd-design/objects/vault).

### `defaults` directory (optional)
Holds the defaults for all object types. If a certain object property has not been specified in the `config` directory, it will be retrieved from the `defaults` directory using the flavour specified in the configured object. If no flavour has been selected, the `default` flavour will be chosen.

You should not need this subdirectory most circumstances.

### `assets` directory (optional)
Optional directory holding the assets you wish to deploy for the Cloud Pak. More information about Cloud Pak for Data assets which can be deployed can be found in object definition [cp4d_asset](/cpd-design/objects/cloud-pak-assets). The directory can be named differently as well, for example `cp4d-assets` or `customer-churn-demo`.

## Vault secrets
User passwords, certificates and other "secret" information is kept in the vault, which can be either a flat file (not encrypted), HashiCorp Vault or the IBM Cloud Secrets Manager service. Some of the deployment configurations require that the vault is pre-populated with secrets which as needed during the deployment. For example, a vSphere deployment needs the vSphere user and password to authenticate to vSphere and Cloud Pak for Data SAML configuration requires the idP certificate.

To set secrets, ensure that the environment variables for the configuration and status directories are set:
```
export STATUS_DIR=/data/status/sample
export CONFIG_DIR=/data/config/sample
```

Set vSphere user secret:
```
./cp-deploy.sh vault set \
    --vault-secret vsphere-user \
    --vault-secret-value super_user@vsphere.local
```

Or, if you want to create the secret from an input file:
```
./cp-deploy.sh vault set \
    --vault-secret kubeconfig \
    --vault-secret-file ~/.kube/config
```
