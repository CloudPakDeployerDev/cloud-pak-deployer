# Cloud Pak Deployer Configuration

The Cloud Pak Deployer includes several sample configurations which you can use as a basis for your own configuration. You can find them in the `sample-configurations` directory of the repository. Copy the sample configuration directory you want to use to your own directory.

It is best not to place it under the repository directory structure, otherwise you may not be able to update (pull) the repository with changes applied on github.ibm.com.

Every configuration have 3 subdirectories:
* `config`: Keeps one or more YAML files with your OpenShift and Cloud Pak configuration
* `defaults`: Keeps the defaults which will be merged with your configuration
* `inventory`: Holds global settings for the configuration such as environment name and type of vault you want to use

You can choose to keep only a single file per subdirectory, or for more complex configurations, you can create multiple yaml files. The generator automatically merges all files in the config and defaults directory.

## `config` directory
Create one or more `.yaml` files holding the configuration you want to provision. You can create Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Security rules, Virtual Server Instances (VSIs), OpenShift clusters, Cloud Pak for Data instances and a few more, simply by adding yaml constructs to files in this directory.

You can find a full list of all supported object types here:
[Configuration objects](/cpd-design/objects/objects)

## `defaults` directory
Holds the defaults for all object types. If a certain object property has not been specified in the `config` directory, it will be retrieved from the `defaults` directory using the flavour specified in the configured object. If no flavour has been selected, the `default` flavour will be chosen.

## `inventory` directory
The Cloud Pak Deployer pipeline has been built using Ansible and it can be configured using "inventory" files. Inventory files hold the global parameters which are available throughout the Ansible playbooks. 

The most important configuration you will find in the Cloud Pak Deployer's inventory files is the vault configuration. All samples default to the **File Vault**, meaning that the vault will be kept in the `vault` directory under the status directory you specify when you run the deployer. Detailed descriptions of the vault settings can be found in the sample inventory file and also here: [vault settings](/cpd-design/objects/vault.mdx).
