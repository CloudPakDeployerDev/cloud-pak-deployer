# Deploy Cloud Pak assets

## Cloud Pak for Data
For Cloud Pak for Data, this stage does the following:
* Deploy Cloud Pak for Data assets which are kept in directories under `assets/cp4d`
* Deploy the Cloud Pak for Data monitors identified with `cp4d_monitors` elements.

### Deploy Cloud Pak for Data assets
All directories under `$CONFIG_DIR/assets/cp4d` are listed and for each directory, the existence of 2 files is checked:
* `cp4d-asset.sh`: Shell script that deploys the asset
* `cp4d-asset.yaml`: Ansible task that deploys the asset

Every asset is expected to be self-contained but critical environment variables such as the Cloud Pak for Data URL, the admin password and the OpenShift project are set. Additionally, `cpdctl` is pre-installed and pre-configured with the current context set to the Cloud Pak for Data instance and admin user.

### Cloud Pak for Data monitors
See [cp4d_monitors](/cpd-design/objects/cp4d_monitors) for more details.
