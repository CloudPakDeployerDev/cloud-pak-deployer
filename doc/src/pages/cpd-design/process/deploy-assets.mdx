# Deploy Cloud Pak assets

Nothing has been implemented yet for this stage. Ideas for the deployment of assets:
* Create Cloud Pak for Data analytics projects and run notebooks
* Load database content
* Create reports and run them automatically
* Deploy machine learning model in Watson Machine Learning

The method for deploying assets should be dynamic, for example by referencing a Git repository and context (directory within the repository); the code within that directory then deploys the asset(s).
