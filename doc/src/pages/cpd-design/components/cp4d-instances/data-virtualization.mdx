# Data Virtualization Instances

Data Virtualization instances can be defined by adding the `instances` section to the `cartridges` entry of catridige `dv`. The following example shows the configuration to define an instance.

```
cp4d:
- project: cpd-instance
  openshift_cluster_name: "{{ env_id }}"
...
  cartridges:
  - name: dv
    size: small
    state: installed
    instances:
    - name: data-virtualization
```

| Property | Description | Mandatory | Allowed Values |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| name | Name of the instance | Yes | |
