# Cloud Pak for Data instances

### Provision instances

Some cartridges have the ability to create one or more instances to run an isolated installation of the cartridge. If instances have been configured for the cartridge, this steps provisions them.
The following Cloud Pak for Data cartridges are currently supported for creating instances:

* [Analytics engine powered by Apache Spark](/cpd-design/components/cp4d-instances/analytics-engine) (`analytics-engine`)
* [DataStage](/cpd-design/components/cp4d-instances/datastage) (`datastage-ent-plus`) 
* [Db2 OLTP](/cpd-design/components/cp4d-instances/db2-oltp) (`db2`)
* [Cognos Analytics](/cpd-design/components/cp4d-instances/cognos-analytics) (`ca`)
* Data Virtualization (`dv`)
* EDB Postgres (`edb_cp4d`)
