# Cloud Pak configuration

### `cp4d`
Defines the Cloud Pak for Data instances to be configured on the OpenShift cluster(s).
```
cp4d:
- project: zen-40
  openshift_cluster_name: sample
  cp4d_version: 4.0
  use_case_files: False
  change_node_settings: True
  image_registry_name: cpd404
  openshift_storage_name: nfs-storage
  
  cartridges:
  - name: cp-foundation
    case_version: 1.6.0
  - name: lite
    subscription_channel: v2.0
    version: 4.0.1
    case_version: 2.0.4
```

#### Properties
| Property | Description                                                          | Mandatory | Allowed values |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| project  | Name of the OpenShift project of the Cloud Pak for Data instance     | Yes       |  |
| openshift_cluster_name | Name of the OpenShift cluster                  | Yes       | Existing `openshift` cluster |
| cp4d_version | Cloud Pak for Data version (not used)                            | No       | 4.0 |
| use_case_files | This property indicates whether or not the case files will be used to install the catalog sources in case of an online install from the entitled registry. If `true`, operator case files are downloaded from the case repository to define the catalog sources. If a private registry has been specified (property `image_registry_name`), it is assumed that case file are used to install the catalog sources.                | No       | True, False (default) |
| change_node_settings | Controls whether the node settings using the machine configs will be applied onto the OpenShift cluster. | No | True, False |
| image_registry_name | When using private registry, specify name of `image_registry` | No       |  |
| openshift_storage_name |References an `openshift_storage` element in the OpenShift cluster that was defined for this Cloud Pak for Data instance. The name must exist under `openshift.[openshift_cluster_name].openshift_storage. | Yes, inferred | |
| cartridges | List of cartridges to install for this Cloud Pak for Data instance. See [Cloud Pak for Data cartridges](/cpd-design/objects/cartridges#cp4d.cartridges) for more details | Yes | |

### `image_registry`
Defines a private registry that will be used for pulling the Cloud Pak container images from. Additionally, if the Cloud Pak entitlement key was specified at run time of the deployer, the images defined by the case files will be mirrored to this private registry.
```
image_registry:
- name: cpd404
  registry_host_name: de.icr.io
  registry_port: 443
  registry_namespace: cpd404
  registry_insecure: false
  registry_trusted_ca_secret: cpd404-ca-bundle
```

#### Properties
| Property | Description                                                          | Mandatory | Allowed values |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| name     | Name by which the image registry is identified.                      | Yes       |  |
| registry_host_name | Host name of the registry server/service.                  | Yes       |  |
| registry_port | Port that the image registry listens on. Default is the https port (443) | No | |
| registry_namespace | Namespace (path) within the registry that holds the Cloud Pak images. Mandatory when using the IBM Cloud Container Registry (ICR)    | No       | |
| registry_insecure | Defines whether insecure registry access with a self-signed certificate is allowed | No       | True, False (default) |
| registry_trusted_ca_secret | Defines the CA bundle to use when connecting to the registry, if not signed with a public CA. | No | |

When mirroring images, the deployer connects to the registry using the host name and port. If the port is omitted, the standard https protocol (443) is used. If a `registry_namespace` is specified, for example when using the IBM Container Registry on IBM Cloud, it will be appended to the registry URL.

The user and password to connect to the registry will be retrieved from the vault, using secret `image-registry-<your_image_registry_name>` and must be stored in the format `registry_user:registry_password`. For example, if you want to connect to the image registry `cpd404` with user `admin` and password `very_s3cret`, you would create a secret as follows:
```
./cp-deploy.sh vault set \
  -vs image-registry-cpd404 \
  -vsv "admin:very_s3cret"
```
